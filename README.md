# DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY-CLASSIFICATION
The script is designed to create and train an Inception-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary image classification, particularly focused on medical imaging. It includes steps for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and data augmentation.

Key Components
1. Importing Necessary Libraries
The script begins by importing the necessary libraries for building and training the model, including TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and OpenCV.

2. Defining the Inception Module
An Inception module is defined, which consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers concatenated together. This module helps the network capture different features at various scales.

3. Building the Model
The model is constructed using several layers, including convolutional layers, batch normalization, max pooling, and custom Inception blocks. The final layers are fully connected (dense) layers that perform the classification. The model's architecture is designed to process and classify images effectively.

4. Loading and Visualizing the Dataset
The script loads images from a specified directory, resizes them, and visualizes a few examples to ensure that the data is being read correctly. This step involves using a function to load and preprocess the images into a format suitable for training.

5. Splitting the Dataset
The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. This partitioning ensures that the model can be trained on one set of images, validated on another, and finally tested on a separate set to evaluate its performance.

6. Compiling and Training the Model
The model is compiled using an optimizer, loss function, and metrics. The training process involves fitting the model to the training data, with the validation data being used to monitor performance and adjust the model's weights. The best model weights are saved during training to ensure that the most accurate model is retained.

7. Plotting Training History
The training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted to visualize the model's performance over time. These plots help in understanding how well the model is learning and if there are any issues like overfitting or underfitting.

8. Data Augmentation Examples
Examples of data augmentation techniques are provided, such as zooming, brightness adjustment, contrast and saturation adjustment, and image flipping. These techniques enhance the model's robustness by providing it with a variety of altered images during training.

Summary
This script provides a comprehensive framework for building, training, and evaluating an Inception-based CNN for binary image classification tasks, with a particular focus on medical imaging. The script also demonstrates various data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness and generalization.
